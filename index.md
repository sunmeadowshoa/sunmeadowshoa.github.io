# FAQ

 - Can I become a Member if I am renting a property in Sun Meadows?
 > Unfortunately, not. Member status is reserved for property owners in order that they may pay annual dues and receive important information regarding their investment in Sun Meadows subdivision. Homeowners are encouraged to share any information they deem important with their tenants and/or their property management agents.
 - What are my HOA dues used to pay for?
 > HOA dues primarily go towards landscaping the common areas, insurance, and deed restriction enforcement.
 - Why do I have to maintain my yard?
 > All HOA members benefit when the neighborhood is aesthetically pleasing; also, it helps to maintain property values in the neighborhood. Finally, City of College Station requires front yard to be maintained otherwise you will be cited for violation.
 - What do I do about concerns of too many people in a household?
 > This is not a restriction governed by our CCR.  If you suspect that a household has more unrelated residents than the City allows, contact College Station Code Enforcement at 979-764-6363.
 - What do I do about loud and disturbing neighbors?
 > The quickest remedy to this type of problem is to call the College Station Police Department's Non-Emergency number, 979-764-3600.  Be sure to ask that the responding officer come by to let you know the resolution of the complaint.
